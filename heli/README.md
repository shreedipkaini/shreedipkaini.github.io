helicopter html5 game - two player version
==========================================
Back in 2011, I came across this post ( http://arandomurl.com/2010/08/05/html5-helicopter.html )
on how to make an html5 helicopter game, and I thought it would be fun to make a two player version.
This was played quite a bit at Freelancers Union (after hours when chair socccer wasnt going on, ofcourse :)
The original code can be found at: https://github.com/daleharvey/helicopter

There is a playable version at:   http://www.diegoolano.com/html5/helicopter/

The thrust command for the black player is handled by the enter key 
whereas the command for the red player is handled by the a key.
